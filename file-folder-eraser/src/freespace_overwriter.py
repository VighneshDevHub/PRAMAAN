"""
Free-space overwriting.

Deleting a file's directory entry doesn't erase its content — the OS
just marks those disk blocks "free" for reuse. Until something else
happens to write over them, a forensic recovery tool (including our own
Module 3!) can carve the "deleted" file straight back out. This module
closes that gap by writing a temp file full of random data into the
free space on the same volume until it's full (or a caller-specified
cap is reached), then deleting that temp file too.

MAX_BYTES exists specifically so automated tests and quick demos don't
have to fill an entire real disk to prove the mechanism works — in a
real deployment, omit the cap (or set it very high) to genuinely
saturate free space.
